# Welcome

> ORGiD SDK is in beta. Libraries may be unstable and APIs are subject to change.

`ORGiD` is a decentralized self-sovereign identity (SSI) and protocol mainly dedicated to being used by organizations but supports the handling of personal identities as well. Decentralization of the solution is made with a smart contract that is deployed in multiple [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) compatible blockchains. Thanks to this, the protocol users can choose a preferable environment for their identity. Anyway, an ORGiD created in any of the blockchains supported is equally able to handle protocol features across the whole ORGiD ecosystem.

The `ORGiD SDK` contains a set of utilities and libraries that help developers to create applications that use the protocol features and extend them.

The `ORGiD SDK` is an open-source project. Everyone is invited to build a future based on open and freely available protocol.

Using the `ORGiD SDK` can be developed a wide spectrum of user-centric applications that utilise possibilities provided by decentralized identity like exceptional identity control, portability, security and data interoperability.
